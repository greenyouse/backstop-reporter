# backstop-reporter

This is a copy of the report UI from BackstopJS repackaged for minimal npm dependencies.

I wanted to try using this with the [wdio-visual-regression-service](https://github.com/zinserjan/wdio-visual-regression-service) for [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io) to have a visual regression dashboard.
